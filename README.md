💡 About the Project

BloodConnect is a web-based frontend project that bridges the gap between blood donors and recipients.

It was created to ensure no one loses a life due to the unavailability of blood at the right time.



Using this platform,

🩸 Donors can book appointments in advance to avoid long queues.

❤️ Recipients can search for and request blood quickly.

📅 Hospitals/organizers can manage requests efficiently.

Built using GenAI-assisted tools to design an elegant and responsive frontend.



✨ Features

✅ Donor registration and booking system

✅ Recipient request and blood search module

✅ Smart appointment scheduling

✅ Clean, responsive UI (works on phones & desktops)

✅ Hosted using GitHub Pages

✅ Lightweight & easy to use — pure HTML, CSS, and JS (no frameworks)
